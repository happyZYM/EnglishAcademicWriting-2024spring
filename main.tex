\section{INTRODUCTION}
\paragraph{}
Considering GenAI's huge effect in the future, it is very important to discuss how AI can help students appropriately; and those CS students who have been helped by GenAI can take part in GenAI's development in return, so it is also an interesting topic. In previous researches, we find that some studies focus on the practicality of AI-assisted programming and examine professional programmers' perspectives on it, like ``A Large-Scale Survey on the Usability of AI Programming Assistants: Successes and Challenges."\cite{liang-2023-LargeScaleSurveyUsability} and ``Expectation vs. Experience: Evaluating the Usability of Code Generation Tools Powered by Large Language Models"\cite{vaithilingam-2022-ExpectationVsExperience}; some studies focus on the general impact of generative AI on education, like ```Students' use of large language models in engineering education: A case study on technology acceptance, perceptions, efficacy, and detection chances"\cite{bernabei-2023-StudentsUseLarge} and ```With Great Power Comes Great Responsibility!': Student and Instructor Perspectives on the influence of LLMs on Undergraduate Engineering Education"\cite{joshi-2023-GreatPowerComes}; others pay attention to exploring AI-assisted computer education(``Beyond Traditional Teaching: Large Language Models as Simulated Teaching Assistants in Computer Science"\cite{liu-2024-TraditionalTeachingLarge}), exploring the possibility of AI teaching assistants from an educator's perspective(``Bob or Bot: Exploring ChatGPT's Answers to University Computer Science Assessment"\cite{richards-2024-BobBotExploring} and ``ChatGPT in the Classroom: An Analysis of Its Strengths and Weaknesses for Solving Undergraduate Computer Science Questions"\cite{joshi-2024-ChatGPTClassroomAnalysis}) or testing AI in answering CS-related questions, investigating the extent of students' trust in AI(``Trust in Generative AI among Students: An exploratory study"\cite{amoozadeh-2024-TrustGenerativeAI}). In summary, the previous studies pay much attention to GenAI's effect on education generally,however,we do not find any study taking research on CS students specifically—a hard-to-begin major's students.As a group whose major is related to AI, it is hard to say whether these students' trust level on GenAI is same with other students'. Also, considering different learning content, it remains unknown whether the general study method(with GenAI) suits the CS student. So in this article, we'll discuss how does students and instructors trust GenAI and how to guide CS students to use GenAI to assist their personalized learning, in the hope of giving CS students some advise through our study.


\section{METHODOLOGY}
\paragraph{}
The methodology for this study is designed to evaluate the impact of generative AI (GenAI) tools on personalized learning within computer science (CS) education. To ensure a comprehensive understanding, the data collection and analysis approach integrates both quantitative and qualitative methods.

\subsection{Survey Design}
\paragraph{}
A structured questionnaire was developed to gather detailed insights from computer science students regarding their use and perceptions of generative AI tools. The questionnaire includes both closed and open-ended questions, addressing various aspects of GenAI usage in CS educational settings.

\paragraph{}
The survey questionnaire is divided into five parts:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Understanding and Usage} This section includes questions about participants' understanding of GenAI and the frequency of its use in their learning. These questions categorize participants into users and non-users of GenAI.
    \item \textbf{Application and Acceptance} This section explores how participants use GenAI, including the specific aspects of their studies where they employ generative AI, their level of acceptance towards AI-assisted learning, and whether AI has enhanced their efficiency.
    \item \textbf{Trust} This section assesses the participants' trust in GenAI, using three targeted questions to address various levels of trust.
    \item \textbf{Concerns} This section addresses participants' concerns about GenAI, such as data privacy, security issues, and potential negative impacts on skill development.
    \item \textbf{Additional Opinions} This final part includes an open-ended question for participants to share any additional opinions on the use of GenAI in CS learning.
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{}
By structuring the survey in this manner, we aim to acquire a comprehensive understanding of participants' opinions on using GenAI in CS learning. Most of the questions are multiple-choice, with four options provided for frequency or degree measurements. For questions regarding reasons and aspects, multiple choices are available, along with an ``Other" option for additional inputs. This design facilitates quantitative analysis of the responses.






%  \begin{itemize}
%  \item Perceptions of students using GenAI(eg. ChatGPT, GitHub Copilot) in programming assignments.

% \item Challenges or barriers encountered when using GenAI as teaching assistant in Computer Science courses.

% \item Suggestions for integrating GenAI into CS curriculum and instructional practices.
% \end{itemize}

\section{RESULTS}
\paragraph{}
The survey questionnaire was distributed to computer science students at various levels of study, from undergraduate to graduate programs. A total of 101 valid responses were collected. Table \ref{table:response_distribution} lists the Distribution of Survey Responses by Academic Level.

\subsection{Students' knowledge about AI}
\paragraph{}
When asked about their level of understanding of generative AI such as ChatGPT, Claude, and Gemini, 42.57\% of respondents indicated they had a general understanding, while 47.52\% said they were familiar with these tools(Figure \ref{fig:understanding}). Only 9.9\% reported being unfamiliar with generative AI. This suggests that the majority of computer science students surveyed have at least a basic understanding of generative AI technologies, which may contribute to their willingness to adopt these tools in their learning process.

\end{figure}
\subsubsection{Why they hold that belief}
\paragraph{}
The reasons for students' trust or distrust in AI were not directly addressed in the survey. However, the frequent use of AI tools and the reported benefits suggest that positive experiences with AI contribute to students' trust. Additionally, the respondents' level of familiarity with generative AI technologies may also influence their trust, as those with a better understanding of AI's capabilities and limitations might have more informed opinions on its reliability.
\subsection{Other important information}
\paragraph{}
When asked about concerns regarding the use of generative AI, 37.62\% of respondents were worried about data privacy and security issues, while 52.48\% were not particularly concerned, and 9.9\% were not concerned at all. This suggests that while data privacy and security are important considerations for a significant portion of students, the majority do not view them as major barriers to using generative AI tools in their learning.

\paragraph{}
Regarding the potential negative impact of generative AI on skill development and employment prospects, 50.5\% of respondents believed it would not have a negative impact, while 12.87\% believed it would, and 36.63\% were unsure. The open-ended responses provided some insights into the reasons behind these beliefs. Some students expressed concerns that AI might replace certain job roles or lower the entry barrier, leading to increased competition. Others noted that AI could help automate low-level tasks, allowing students to focus on higher-level skills and adapt to the changing landscape of the computer science field.

\paragraph{}
These results provide a nuanced picture of computer science students' perceptions and experiences with generative AI in their learning. While the majority of respondents recognize the benefits and actively use these tools, there are still concerns and uncertainties that need to be addressed through further research, education, and guidance on the responsible and effective integration of AI in computer science education.
